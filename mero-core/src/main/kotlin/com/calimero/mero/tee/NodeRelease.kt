/*
 * Trusting a TEE node's image by its signed release, fetched at run time from anywhere,
 * instead of shipping the release's `published-mrtds.json` with the app — port of mero-js
 * `src/sealed/release.ts`.
 *
 * Each mero-tee node release publishes `published-mrtds.json` (the measurements of its image)
 * with a cosign keyless bundle, signed by the mero-tee release workflow on GitHub Actions.
 * [verifySignedNodeRelease] checks that signature against the Sigstore trust root embedded in
 * this SDK, so the file can come from any source: the cloud's mirror, a mirror of your own, or
 * a file bundled with the app. None of them is trusted.
 *
 * What is trusted: the signer ([NODE_RELEASE_SIGNER], the identity core pins as
 * `NODE_RELEASE_IDENTITY`), the Sigstore public-good trust root, and the minimum release you
 * pass. What is not: the transport, the server that serves the release, and the relay's choice
 * of release — a relay can present any genuinely signed release at or above the minimum and no
 * other, and its quote must then match that release's measurements exactly.
