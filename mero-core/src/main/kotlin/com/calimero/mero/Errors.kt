/*
 * What the cloud node's refusals mean to a caller (mero-js `cloud-v2/errors.ts`).
 *
 * The node answers an error as `{ error: CODE, message, details }` with an HTTP status.
 * [errorFrom] is the one place the client turns that into an exception a caller can switch on;
 * every call, view and event stream goes through it. It matches the status and the code
 * together, never the status alone: the node sends other 409s (`CONFLICT`, `NOT_INSTALLED`) that
 * are not an idempotency mismatch, and other 413s (`TOO_LARGE` from the sealed transport) that are
 * not oversized call arguments. Anything it does not recognise stays a plain [CalimeroError]
 * carrying both.
 *
 * Every typed error extends [CalimeroError], so `catch (e: CalimeroError)` and its [CalimeroError.status]
 * and [CalimeroError.code] keep working for all of them.
