# Releasing

How a change in kotlin-sdk becomes a release. Agents and people read this before
committing, titling a pull request, or releasing. The first part is the set of
rules every calimero-network repository that ships releases shares; the second
is what is specific to this repository.

<!-- shared-release-rules:start -->
## Shared rules

These rules are the same, word for word, in every calimero-network repository
that ships releases. The canonical copy is in
[core's RELEASING.md](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/blob/master/RELEASING.md);
change it there first, then copy the text between the `shared-release-rules`
markers into each repository unchanged. What differs per repository (branches,
tags, where things are published, manual steps) is in the repository section.

### The PR title is the release commit

Pull requests are squash-merged, so the PR title becomes the single commit that
lands on the default branch, and that commit is what release automation reads.
Commits inside the PR do not count. Write the title as a
[Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), lower case:
`<type>(<optional scope>): <subject>`.

Where a repository releases from its commits (semantic-release; the repository
section says whether it does), the type picks the version bump:

| PR title | Release |
| --- | --- |
| `feat: ...` | minor |
| `fix:`, `perf:` | patch |
| `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `revert:` | none |
| `<type>!: ...`, or a `BREAKING-CHANGE:` footer | major |

- Only the hyphenated `BREAKING-CHANGE:` footer keyword makes a major (besides
  `!`). The commit parser matches note keywords case-insensitively at the start
  of any line of the message, so with the default keyword `BREAKING CHANGE` a
  body line that happened to wrap onto "breaking change ..." published
  mero-react 7.0.0 from a commit that touched only CI and a test fixture. The
  `.releaserc.json` files therefore set `parserOpts.noteKeywords` to
  `["BREAKING-CHANGE"]`, and prose that says "breaking change" does nothing.
- Prefer `!` in the title over the footer: the title is visible in review,
  while the squash commit's body is whatever the merge dialog fills in.
- Only `feat:`, `fix:` and `perf:` release (plus a major from `!` or the
  footer); every other type releases nothing. A change to what users read in
  the package (a README shipped to npm, docstrings) that should reach them is
  titled `fix(docs):` (a patch). To ship a change that touches no feature or
  fix (e.g. a dependency bump consumers need), title it `fix(deps): ...`.
- Choose the type for what the change does to whoever depends on the release,
  not for the size of the diff.

### What counts as breaking

For a library (an SDK, a client, a package other code imports), a change is
breaking when code that built and worked against the previous release can stop
building or behave differently:

- an export, type, method, function or field is removed or renamed;
- a signature changes (a parameter added without a default, a parameter or
  return type changed, a call that becomes async);
- a field of a request, option or config type becomes required;
- accepted values narrow (an enum loses a member, validation refuses input it
  used to accept);
- the error a caller can catch or match on changes type or code.

Additions (a new export, method or optional field) are `feat`.

For an app or a service (a node, an image, a deployed backend), breaking is
what its users or operators must act on: an API route or field removed or
changed, stored data or a wire format that the previous release cannot read
or that cannot be read back, configuration or flags that must change, clients
that must upgrade first. Core declares these through its
[compatibility rules](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/blob/master/docs/src/content/docs/operate/compatibility.mdx)
(deprecations, hard cutovers), not through the title alone.

### Releases happen on merge, through automation

- A repository's workflows release it, triggered by a merge to the release
  branch (or, where the repository section says so, by a tag a human pushes).
  When a workflow's tag or pull request must start another workflow, it acts as
  the organization's GitHub App (`vars.ACTIONS_APP_ID` /
  `secrets.ACTIONS_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`): anything pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  starts no workflow.
- Never push a tag, create a GitHub Release, publish a package or image, or
  edit a version number by hand, unless the repository section names that
  step as manual and a human asked for it.
- AI agents never do any of these without a human's explicit approval, even
  when the repository section lists the step. An agent's part ends at a pull
  request with the right title.
- A bad release is fixed by the next release (a `fix:` pull request), not by
  moving or deleting a tag: npm, PyPI, Maven Central and crates.io never take
  a published version back.

### OpenAPI sync pull requests from core

The SDKs generate their HTTP clients from core's `docs/public/openapi.json`.
When it changes on core's master, core's
[`sdk-openapi-sync.yml`](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/blob/master/.github/workflows/sdk-openapi-sync.yml)
has each SDK re-vendor it on the machine-owned branch `chore/core-openapi` and
open (or refresh) one pull request. Core's classifier titles that pull request
from what changed in the generated surface: `feat(api)!:` when something a
caller uses was removed or changed, `feat(api):` when something was only
added, `chore(api):` otherwise (descriptions only), which releases nothing:
that change reaches consumers with the SDK's next release.

Don't retitle these down: `feat(api)!:` turned into `feat(api):` ships a
breaking change as a minor to every consumer on a `^` range. Retitle up if the
classifier missed a break. Don't push to `chore/core-openapi`; the workflow
force-pushes it. Fix the document or the generator in core instead.

### A major stops the fleet's automatic bumps

When a package is published, its repository's fleet-bump workflow opens a pull
request in every consumer listed in its `.github/fleet.json`.
`bump-fleet.sh` skips a jump across a major version unless the run sets
`allow_major` (core's fleet bump skips majors the same way), because such a bump
would arrive red on every release. So after a major, consumers stay on the old
major and stop receiving that package's releases until someone moves them on
purpose: plan the consumers' migration pull requests as part of shipping a
major, and expect an accidental major to cut the whole fleet off silently.

### Pre-release lines

Some repositories also publish pre-releases (core's `X.Y.Z-rc.N`, the `rc`
channel of calimero-client-py). Which branch makes which kind of release, and
how a pre-release line becomes a final, is in the repository section. Promoting
a line is a human's decision.

### Before you commit, title a pull request, or release

1. The title is a Conventional Commit whose type matches the table above and
   the breaking rules.
2. A breaking change has `!` in the title and says in the PR body what callers
   must change; where the repository keeps a hand-written changelog, the PR
   adds its entry.
3. Version fields, tags and release configuration are left alone unless that is
   the point of the PR and a human asked for it.
4. After the merge, check that the release landed as the repository section
   describes.

## This repository: kotlin-sdk

[PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md) has the details (coordinates, the one-time
Central setup, consuming from Central and GitHub Packages, local publishing);
this section is the release flow and what an agent must know about it.

### How a release is triggered

1. Every push to `main` (a merged pull request) runs
   [`release-on-merge.yml`](.github/workflows/release-on-merge.yml), which runs
   semantic-release with [`.releaserc.json`](.releaserc.json) over the
   conventional commits since the last `v*` tag, using the table in the shared
   rules. When they call for a release it pushes the tag `vX.Y.Z` and creates the
   GitHub Release with generated notes, as the organization's GitHub App, so the
   tag starts the next workflow.
2. The tag runs [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml):
   - `network.calimero:mero-core` and `network.calimero:mero-compose` to
     **GitHub Packages**;
   - the same, signed, to **Maven Central** in the `maven-central` environment.
     `publishingType` is `AUTOMATIC`: the Portal publishes the bundle as soon as
     it validates, with no click. A Central version can never be replaced or
     deleted, so every merge that releases is permanent. Without the Central
     secrets this step is skipped with a warning;
   - the GitHub Release, only when release-on-merge did not create it.

### Version, tags and changelog

- The version is the tag: `release.yml` passes `-PVERSION_NAME` from it.
  `VERSION_NAME` in `gradle.properties` is only the default for local builds, and
  nothing is committed back to `main` on release.
- Tags are `v${version}`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` is hand-written: a pull request that changes what the SDK does
  adds its entry under `## Unreleased`. The per-version commit list is the
  GitHub Release.
- There is no pre-release line in the automation: every release from `main` is a
  final. GitHub Packages is where an internal or pre-release build goes
  ([PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md)).

### Manual steps that need a human

- A tag pushed by hand (`git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`) releases
  through `release.yml` the same way, to Maven Central too. Only a human does
  this, for a hotfix.
- The Central credentials and signing key (`MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME`,
  `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD`, `SIGNING_KEY`, `SIGNING_PASSWORD`) and any required
  reviewers on the `maven-central` environment are set up by a human
  (PUBLISHING.md, "One-time setup").

### Checking that a release landed

- The tag `vX.Y.Z` and its GitHub Release exist, and the `Release` run on the
  tag is green in all three jobs (a skipped Central step shows as a warning).
- `network.calimero:mero-core:X.Y.Z` is on Maven Central (search
  [central.sonatype.com](https://central.sonatype.com/); it can take a while to
  appear) and in this repository's GitHub Packages.

### How consumers are bumped

There is no fleet bump for this SDK. The Android apps in `calimero-network/apps`
pin it (`meroSdk` in each app's `gradle/libs.versions.toml`) and are moved by
hand. The SDK follows core's API through the OpenAPI sync in the shared rules.
