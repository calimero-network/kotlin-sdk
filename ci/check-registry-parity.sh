# check-registry-parity.sh — every public SDK method must be reachable from the
# sample app's SDK Explorer.
#
# The sample app doubles as the SDK's living documentation: if a method exists on
# CalimeroClient but no `SDKOperation` invokes it, the explorer quietly
# stops covering part of the surface. This script diffs the two lists and fails
# with the missing names.
#
# Methods that intentionally have no explorer entry go in EXCLUDED below, with a
# reason — internal plumbing, or things the UI drives on your behalf.
#
# Usage: ./ci/check-registry-parity.sh   (from the repo root)
